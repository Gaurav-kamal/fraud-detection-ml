Credit Card Fraud Detection

Overview

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. Various classification models are applied to identify fraudulent activities and minimize financial losses.

Features

Data preprocessing and feature engineering

Implementation of various classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)

Model evaluation using precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC

Hyperparameter tuning for model optimization

Dataset

The dataset consists of anonymized credit card transaction records labeled as fraudulent or non-fraudulent. It includes features such as transaction amount, time, and various engineered features.
